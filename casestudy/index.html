                <p>The UC Davis Seal Scavenger Hunt website is a web-based interactive game designed for students and visitors to explore the UC Davis campus while engaging with its landmarks. The target audience for this project is primarily UC Davis students, prospective students, and campus visitors. The goal of the project is to create an engaging and educational experience that encourages users to explore various locations on campus, learn about UC Davis landmarks, and unlock the Davis seal by answering a series of questions.</p>

            <h2>UX Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>During the initial stages of the project, comparative research was conducted to analyze existing scavenger hunt games and interactive websites. This research provided insights into the best practices and design patterns employed by similar projects. It also helped in understanding the preferences and expectations of the target audience.</p>
                <p>The research findings highlighted the importance of clear instructions, engaging visuals, intuitive user interfaces, and providing hints to guide users in their exploration. As a result, we decided to incorporate these elements into the design of the UC Davis Seal Scavenger Hunt website to ensure a positive user experience.</p>
                <p> Conducting target audience interviews was crucial in understanding the needs, preferences, and expectations of the UC Davis students, prospective students, and campus visitors who would be using the scavenger hunt website. This interview assignment provided valuable insights into the target audience's motivations for participating in the game, their level of familiarity with the UC Davis campus, and their desired user experience. By gathering firsthand feedback, we were able to tailor the design, content, and interactive elements of the website to better meet the target audience's needs. The insights from the interviews also helped in determining the appropriate level of challenge, the types of questions and landmarks to include, and the overall tone and style of the game.</p>

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The visual design of the UC Davis Seal Scavenger Hunt website aimed to reflect the spirit and identity of the UC Davis campus while maintaining a playful and interactive atmosphere. The chosen color scheme, which consisted of a vibrant blue background (#022851) and a bright yellow header (#FFBF00), evoked the school's colors and fostered a sense of school pride.</p>
                <p>The typography and layout were carefully selected to enhance readability and ensure a cohesive visual experience across different screen sizes. The use of large headings, such as in the "Welcome to UC Davis Seal Scavenger Hunt" title, helped to capture the users' attention and convey the main purpose of the website.</p>
                <p> The wireframe assignment involved creating a visual blueprint of the website's layout and structure before moving on to the detailed design and development stages. This assignment was important because it allowed us plan and organize the content, user interface, and interactive elements of the website in a systematic manner. By mapping out the overall structure and flow of the website, the wireframe assignment helped to identify potential usability issues, refine the user experience, and align stakeholders' expectations. It also served as a reference for us throughout the project, ensuring consistency and coherence in the final product.

            <h2>User Interface</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The user interface (UI) of the UC Davis Seal Scavenger Hunt website was designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. The main interactive element was a large image of the UC Davis seal, which served as a clickable game board. By clicking on different parts of the seal, users triggered question prompts related to specific landmarks on campus.</p>
                <p>The UI included a score display that updated dynamically as users answered questions correctly. Hints were provided to guide users if they encountered difficulties, and the hints were displayed in a fixed position on the page for easy reference.</p>
                <p>The inclusion of a modal dialog for each question ensured a focused and immersive experience. Users were presented with a question and an input field to provide their answers. Upon submitting an answer, immediate feedback was provided, and the next question or completion message was displayed accordingly.</p>

            <h2>Revisions</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>User testing played a crucial role in refining the UC Davis Seal Scavenger Hunt website. Through usability testing sessions, valuable feedback was gathered, leading to improvements in the clarity of instructions, question prompts, and overall usability.</p>
                <p>Some revisions were made based on user feedback, such as increasing the font size for better readability and providing additional visual cues to guide users through the game. User feedback also prompted the addition of a completion message to celebrate users' achievements once they answered all the questions correctly.</p>
                <p> 
                    During the usability testing assignment, users performed specific tasks on the website while we observed their actions and collected feedback. This feedback helped identify areas that needed improvement, such as unclear instructions, confusing question prompts, and navigation issues.
                    Based on the feedback, we made code revisions to address the identified issues. They refined instructions, adjusted the placement and design of interactive elements, optimized responsiveness for different devices, and enhanced visual cues and feedback.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Working on the UC Davis Seal Scavenger Hunt project provided valuable insights into the importance of user research, iterative design, and usability testing. By incorporating user feedback, we were able to refine the game's design and enhance the user experience.</p>
                <p>The project's success lies in its ability to engage users, encourage exploration of the UC Davis campus, and provide educational information about its landmarks. The visual design, intuitive user interface, and inclusion of hints and question prompts were key factors in achieving these goals.</p>
                <p>The most challenging aspect of the project was striking a balance between providing enough information to guide users and allowing them the freedom to explore and discover answers on their own. However, this challenge was also the most rewarding aspect, as it led to a more immersive and engaging experience.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the UC Davis Seal Scavenger Hunt website showcases the importance of user-centered design, iterative development, and the incorporation of feedback. By combining interactive elements, educational content, and a visually appealing design, the project successfully promotes exploration and learning within the UC Davis community.</p>
