    <h1> Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>
        My topic is going to be on a scavenger hunt involving the seal. I am working on this project with Vishnu Vennelekanti. This project will have to do with newly admitted UC Davis students, who want to learn more about the history of Davis. They will be able to tour the city using the seal, which will have a scavenger hunt inside of it. At each landmark at Davis, student's will be able to scan a QR code which has information about the landmark, and where to go next. Additionally, we plan on incorporating a map inside the seal that takes students around the city, highlighting significant locations and providing historical context. We are excited to work on this project and believe it will be a fun and educational way for students to become more familiar with their new surroundings.
