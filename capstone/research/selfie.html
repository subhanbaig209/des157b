    <h1> Seal Selfie</h1>

    <p>One aspect of the Davis city seal that interests me the most is the symbolism behind the central image, which depicts the convergence of geographical and infrastructural elements that are at the core of the city's founding and development. The intersecting lines represent important factors such as Putah Creek, the Railroad, the Lincoln Highway, Interstate 80, and Highway 113. The seal also showcases the transformation of the city's landscape and livelihood over time, from the devastation of an ancient people and culture to the immigration of white settlers and the incorporation of the City of Davis.
